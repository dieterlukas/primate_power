# primate_power

This repository contains the data, code, and results for the paper by Huchard, Kappeler, Smit, Fichtel & Lukas on the correlates of inter-sexual power in primate species (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2500405122). A copy of these files has also been archived at Edmond (Lukas, Dieter, 2025, "Data and code associated with "The evolution of male-female dominance relations in primate societies"", https://doi.org/10.17617/3.OOC1BX, Edmond). Please cite the paper/data when building on this analysis.

All analyses are performed in R. To repeat the analyses, download the R markdown file "Code_IntersexDominance.Rmd" to a local folder on your computer. There is an option in the file to directly load all data and additional code scripts from GitHub. Alternatively, download the folders "data" and "AnalysisCode" to your computer. Results will be saved as csv files in the "results" folder, and figures will be saved as pdf files in the "figures" folder. These folders here already contain the respective output.
