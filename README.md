# primate_power

Repository to store data, code, and results for the project by Huchard, Lukas, Smit, Fichtel & Kappeler on the correlates of inter-sexual power in primate species.

To repeat the analyses, download the files to a local folder on your computer. Open the rmarkdown file Code_IntersexDominance.Rmd and run the code. The file refers to the data that is provided in the "data folder" and loads additional code files in the "AnalysisCode" folder. Results will be saved as csv files in the "results" folder, and figures will be saved as pdf files in the "figures" folder
